            <p style="color: white; font-size: x-large;">

                Hygiene is a series of practices performed to preserve health. According to the World Health
                Organization (WHO), "Hygiene refers to conditions and practices that help to maintain health and prevent
                the spread of diseases." Personal hygiene refers to maintaining the body's cleanliness. Hygiene
                activities can be grouped into the following: home and everyday hygiene, personal hygiene, medical
                hygiene, sleep hygiene and food hygiene.

                Home and every day hygiene includes hand washing, respiratory
                hygiene, food hygiene at home, hygiene in the kitchen, hygiene in the bathroom, laundry hygiene and
                medical hygiene at home.

                Many people equate hygiene with 'cleanliness,' but hygiene is a broad term. It includes such personal
                habit choices as how frequently to take a shower or bath, wash hands, trim fingernails, and wash
                clothes. It also includes attention to keeping surfaces in the home and workplace clean, including
                bathroom facilities. Some regular hygiene practices may be considered good habits by the society, while
                the neglect of hygiene can be considered disgusting, disrespectful, or threatening.
