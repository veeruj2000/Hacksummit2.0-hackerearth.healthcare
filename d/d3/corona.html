            <h2 style="color: white;">How does the coronavirus spread?</h2>

            <p style="font-size: x-large; color: white;">
                As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released
                into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets
                may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and
                accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation.
                This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.
