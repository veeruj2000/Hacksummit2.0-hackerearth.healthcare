            <p style="color: white; font-size: x-large;">
                In nutrition, diet is the sum of food consumed by a person or other organism. The word diet often
                implies the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons (with the two
                often being related). Although humans are omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food
                preferences or some food taboos. This may be due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual
                dietary choices may be more or less healthy.

                Complete nutrition requires ingestion and absorption of vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids from
                protein and essential fatty acids from fat-containing food, also food energy in the form of
                carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Dietary habits and choices play a significant role in the quality of
                life, health and longevity.
