            <p style="color: white; font-size: x-large;">

                Malaria is an acute febrile illness. In a non-immune individual, symptoms usually appear 10–15 days
                after the infective mosquito bite. The first symptoms – fever, headache, and chills – may be mild and
                difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within 24 hours, P. falciparum malaria can progress to
                severe illness, often leading to death.
                <br>
                <br>
                Children with severe malaria frequently develop one or more of the following symptoms: severe anaemia,
                respiratory distress in relation to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral malaria. In adults, multi-organ
                failure is also frequent. In malaria endemic areas, people may develop partial immunity, allowing
                asymptomatic infections to occur.

            <h3 style="color: white; font-size: xx-large;"> <u> Who is at risk?</u></h3>

            <br>

            <p style="color: white; font-size: x-large;">
                In 2019, nearly half of the world's population was at risk of malaria. Most malaria cases and deaths
                occur in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the WHO regions of South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Western
                Pacific, and the Americas are also at risk.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: white; font-size: xx-large;"> <u>Prevention</u></h3>
            <br>

            <p style="color: white; font-size: x-large;">

                Vector control is the main way to prevent and reduce malaria transmission. If coverage of vector control
                interventions within a specific area is high enough, then a measure of protection will be conferred
                across the community.
                <br>
                <br>
                WHO recommends protection for all people at risk of malaria with effective malaria vector control. Two
                forms of vector control – insecticide-treated mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying – are effective
                in a wide range of circumstances.
